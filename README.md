# RGB Color Guessing Game

HTML CSS JavaScript based RGB Color Guessing Game.

This is a first version of HTML/JavaScript/CSS based color guessing game. It presents the user with a number of colored tiles depending on the mode (Default mode is Medium and throws 6 colored tiles to guess out of). The user is expected to select the color matching the RGB values displayed in the header. Simple. If the guess is wrong, the tile disappears.

This example is taken from Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele at Udemy.
